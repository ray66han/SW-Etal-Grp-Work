# This project is based on a scenario in which a developer team is charged with developing a chore tracking system. The system's goal is to assist families or groups of people in keeping track of household duties and ensuring that they are finished on time.

# There are various actors in the system, including the administrator, the user, and the family. The administrator is in charge of running the system, while the user is in charge of entering and tracking their chores. A family actor is a group of users who live in the same house and can see one other's tasks.

# A UML use case diagram was produced to help visualise the system. Several use scenarios for the actors are depicted in this graphic, including logging in, viewing tasks, and assigning tasks to specific people.

# The development team also considered several methods for encouraging users to keep using the system and finishing their duties. Gamification, such as incentives and leaderboards, and the use of charts and data to show users their progress were among the ideas.

# Overall, the goal of this project is to develop an useful and user-friendly task tracking system that can assist families or groups of individuals in staying organised and on top of home chores.
